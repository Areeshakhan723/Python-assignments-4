Fahrenheit is another unit for temperature, but the scale is different from Celsius -- for example, 0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees Fahrenheit!\n","\n","The equation you should use for converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius is the following:\n","\n","degrees_celsius = (degrees_fahrenheit - 32) * 5.0/9.0\n","\n","(Note.
